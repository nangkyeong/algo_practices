let's practice algorithm questions!



# TopCoder
I learned basic algorithms for computer science by this book.

https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=7333164

### Directories 
- LinearSearch
- GraphSearch

Files in these directories are codes for solving the questions in the book.

Some parts of the code is not the same as it is on the book! (such as variable names...)

Let me know if you find any mistakes... 

Any suggestions for improvement will be very welcomed! :D
